# Internship-Day---8
Building a Chatbot


We begin by using the print function to let the user know its talking to a chatbot.
We then use the while True function to create a loop so that it can execute repeadtly.
Then we use the if elif else to aloow the program to execute different code when certain condition are met.
We also create a block of code(help) to let the user find out all the basic operation our program can execute like greeting,anime,games,ect.
Then we use the break statement so that the loop can be broken and the execution stops.
